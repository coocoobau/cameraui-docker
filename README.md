# camera.ui — Docker

Docker images for [camera.ui](https://github.com/cameraui/camera.ui), one per hardware target, on Ubuntu 24.04.

## Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d
# then open https://<host>:3443   (self-signed cert on first start)
```

First boot installs the server and comes up after a few minutes — follow it with `docker compose logs -f`.

## Image flavors

| Flavor           | Tag             | Hardware acceleration                                                  | Arch          |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| CPU              | `latest`        | software                                                               | amd64 + arm64 |
| Intel            | `intel`         | Quick Sync / VA-API + OpenCL                                           | amd64         |
| NVIDIA           | `nvidia`        | NVENC / NVDEC + CUDA 13 (driver 580+)                                  | amd64         |
| NVIDIA (TensorRT) | `nvidia-tensorrt` | NVENC / NVDEC + CUDA 13 + TensorRT (driver 580+) | amd64 |
| NVIDIA (CUDA 12) | `nvidia-cuda12` | NVENC / NVDEC + CUDA 12, for older drivers with the ONNX Legacy plugin | amd64         |
| AMD              | `amd`           | Mesa VA-API + OpenCL                                                   | amd64         |

Pick the flavor for your machine via its compose override (`docker-compose.{intel,nvidia,amd}.yml`).

## Hardware acceleration & AI accelerators

AI accelerators (Coral, Hailo, Intel NPU) work with **any** flavor — they only need their device node passed through (see the commented `devices:` section in `docker-compose.yml`) plus a host driver.

To check what your host is missing (NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Hailo kernel driver, device nodes):

```bash
sudo ./scripts/host/cameraui-host.sh check     # read-only diagnosis
sudo ./scripts/host/cameraui-host.sh nvidia    # install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit
sudo ./scripts/host/cameraui-host.sh hailo     # build + install the Hailo PCIe driver
sudo ./scripts/host/cameraui-host.sh coral     # install the gasket driver (PCIe/M.2 Coral)
```

On boot the container logs which devices actually arrived: `[setup] accelerator devices: ...` — if a device shows `✗` there but exists on the host, it is missing from your compose `devices:` list.

## Networking

Host networking (the compose default) is recommended — camera.ui uses it for mDNS/Bonjour (HomeKit pairing, ONVIF discovery) and WebRTC live view.

## Data

All state lives in the `/data` volume (config, database, recordings, TLS certs). Back up the `cameraui-data` volume.

## Worker

A second machine can join your camera.ui as a worker: it runs no UI of its own and takes over camera workloads (decoding, detection, recording) the master offloads to it. Generate a pairing code on the master (Workers view), fill it into [`docker-compose.worker.yml`](./docker-compose.worker.yml) together with the master's address, then:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.worker.yml up -d
```

The code is only needed once, the worker stores its credentials and reconnects on its own. Hardware acceleration works the same as on the main deployment.

## Proxmox

See [`proxmox/`](./proxmox) to run camera.ui in a Proxmox LXC.
